## About the Project

This project was developed with the aim of assisting a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in financial management, providing a clear and detailed view of income and expenses through an administrative dashboard. Furthermore, we implemented functionalities for managing subscribers of the plans proposed for the NGO, contributing to a more efficient and organized administration. The interfaces were created using [shadcn/ui][shadcn/ui].
